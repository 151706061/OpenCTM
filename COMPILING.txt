1. PREREQUISITES
================

In order to compile the OpenCTM shared library, all you need is a supported
compiler and it should compile right out of the box.

In order to compile the entire OpenCTM package, including documentation and the
tools, there are some extra dependencies:

- To build all the tools, you need GLUT, and for Un*x/X11 you also need
  GTK+ 2.0 (Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev).

- To build the documentation you need Doxygen (www.doxygen.org) and a full
  LaTeX installation (see TeX Live - http://www.tug.org/texlive/).


2. COMPILING
============

There are a few makefiles for different systems and compilers. Just pick the
one that fits your system, and run "make" on the corresponding file. Here are
a few specific instructions:


2.1 Windows, MinGW32
--------------------

mingw32-make -f Makefile.mingw


2.2 Windows, MS Visual Studio (Express) 2008
--------------------------------------------

nmake /f Makefile.msvc


2.3 Mac OS X
------------

make -f Makefile.macosx


2.4 Linux
---------

make -f Makefile.linux


2.5 OpenSolaris
---------------

gmake -f Makefile.linux


3. BUILD TARGETS
================

By default, the entire OpenCTM package is compiled when make is run. To limit
what is built, use one of the following build targets (just append it to the
end of the make command line):

 openctm       (the shared library)
 toolset       (the tools)
 documentation (the HTML and PDF documentation)
 clean         (clean all the built files - start from scratch)

For instance, to just build the OpenCTM shared library under Windows with
MS Visual Studio, type:

 nmake /f Makefile.msvc openctm
