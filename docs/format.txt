OpenCTM Format Specification
============================

1. Introduction
---------------

This document describes version 1.0 of the OpenCTM file format.


2. File format specification
----------------------------

TBD


2.1 Data formats
----------------

All integer fields are stored in little endian format (least significant byte
first).

All floating point fields are stored in 32-bit binary IEEE 754 format (little
endian).

All strings are stored as a 32-bit integer string length (number of bytes)
followed by a UTF-8 format string (there is no zero termination and no BOM).


2.2 Header
----------

The file must start with a header, which looks as follows:

Offset    Size        Value         Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0         32 bits     0x4d54434f    Magic identifier ("OCTM" when read as ASCII)
4         32 bits     0x00000100    File format version (version 1.0)
...

3. Recommendations
------------------

There are several aspects of a 3D model that are not mandated by this
specification. However, the specification gives a set of recommendations
(best practice) that should be followed whenever possible and applicable, in
order to improve interchangeability of 3D data between different softwares and
systems.

Here are the recommendations:

1) The "up" direction of 3D coordinates should be the positive Z axis.
2) The unit of 3D coordinates should be millimeters (mm).
3) Given the three coordinates of a triangle (P1, P2, P3), the front/up
   direction of the triangle ("flat normal") should be defined by the
   normalized cross product: (P2 - P1) X (P3 - P1).
