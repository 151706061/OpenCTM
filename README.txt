1. INTRODUCTION
===============

Welcome to OpenCTM!

OpenCTM is a file format, a software library and a tool set for compression of
3D triangle meshes. The geometry is compressed to a fraction of comparable file
formats (3DS, STL, COLLADA, VRML...), and the format is easily accessible
through a simple, portable API.

The library is written in portable C (C99), and should compile nicely on any
32/64-bit system regardless of endianity (big endian or little endian).

The OpenCTM API and the OpenCTM tools are released under the zlib/libpng

3. CREDITS
==========

Many people have helped out in the development process of OpenCTM, with
valuable feedback, programming efforts, test models and conceptual ideas.
Also, OpenCTM relies heavily on many other open source projects.

Here is an incomplete list of persons that deserve credit:

- Igor Pavlov (LZMA library)
- Jonas Innala (COLLADA importer)
- Lee Thomason (TinyXML)
- Diego Nehab (RPly - for loading PLY files)
- Lev Povalahev, Marcelo E. Magallon, Milan Ikits (GLEW)
- Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding (libjpeg)

During the development of OpenCTM, the following software has been used
extensively:

- Ubuntu (www.ubuntu.com)
- Blender (www.blender.org)
- GCC (gcc.gnu.org)
- SciTE (www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html)
- Notepad++ (notepad-plus.sourceforge.net)
- Smultron (smultron.sourceforge.net)
