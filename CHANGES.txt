v1.0.1 - 2009.11.15
-------------------
- Notable reduction of the memory footprint by tuning of the LZMA compression
  parameters.

- Added a Wavefront OBJ file importer/exporter.

- Some improvements to ctmviewer and ctmconv.

- Some directory structure and build system cleanups.


v1.0 - 2009.11.09
-----------------
- Added a COLLADA converter module to the ctmconv program.

- Added Python bindings and a demo Python program.

- Improved the internal mesh integrity checking, to minimize the risk of invalid
  data processing.

- Improved the file format specification document.


v0.8 (beta) - 2009.09.14
------------------------
- Introduced a new API function for controlling the compression level
  (ctmCompressionLevel), and set the default compression level to 5 (rather
  than 9, which would eat a lot of memory, usally without much difference).

- Changed the name "texture map" in the API to "UV map" (and all
  corresponding constant and function names). This is more in line with
  the nomenclature of most 3D authoring software, and avoids the confusion
  with the term texture mapping in 3D hardware (which is not limited to
  2D UV mapping coordinates).

- A few updates to the documentation.


v0.7 (beta) - 2009.08.29
------------------------
- This was the first public release of OpenCTM.
